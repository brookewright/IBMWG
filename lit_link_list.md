### Index Based Methods
* [DLMtool](https://www.datalimitedtoolkit.org/) provides a large number of possible index-based methods and a framework for conducting closed-loop simulations
* [Geromont and Butterworth](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/72/1/262/821583) 2015b compares historical performance of simple index-based approaches to age-based methods for stocks in this region
* [Wiedenmann](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2018.09.018) et al. 2019 applies a number of index-based methods to actual stocks in this region and compares results to age-based methods
* [Klaer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783612002561) et al. 2012 applies an average length-based approach in Australia
* [Little](https://doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsr019) et al. 2011 examines a number of index-based methods in closed-loop simulation for Southeast Australia stocks
* [Smith](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783608001835) et al. 2008 lessons learned from SE Australia from applying index-based methods
* [Then](https://doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsx177) et al. 2018 introduces a length-based method

### Closed-loop simulations
* [Geromont and Butterworth](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/72/1/251/815189) 2015a demonstrates how to test index-based methods through closed-loop simulation
* [Fay](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783611001640) et al. 2011 examines spatial impact on MSE for a stock
